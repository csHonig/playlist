# Playlist

Playlist class that supports adding and removing songs, listing and shuffled listing.

## Included Files

- `CMakeLists.txt`: For complex projects, `cmake CMakeLists.txt` will
  generate a `Makefile`. We can then use `make` to compile the
  project. Optional for a small project like this, but included as an
  example.

- `playlist.cpp`: Definitions for playlist functions

- `playlist.h`: Header file for playlist

- `main.cpp`: Runs all tests

- `output.txt`: Output from `./simplecompile.sh > output.txt 2>&1`
showing how the program is compiled and run

- `simplecompile.sh`: Unix bash script file to compile, run 
and then delete the executable. Can be used to create an output.txt file


## Compile and Run

```shell script
./simplecompile.sh
```
